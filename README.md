In January 2018 we [reported on new figures revealing that rough sleeping in England had increased for the seventh year in a row](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-42817123).

The story was complemented by video of 'Four stories of rough sleeping in England' and 'Homelessness: 5 things you might not know', along with quotes from housing charity Shelter, homelessness charities St Mungo's and Crisis, the National Audit Office, the Local Government Association and the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG).
